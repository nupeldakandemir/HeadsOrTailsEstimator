# HeadsOrTailsEstimator
By performing 5000 simulated coin tosses, it calculates the probability that the data will continue to show no heads after each toss, and produces a graph comparing this with the expected value of 0.5.

- Write a script called CoinTest.m that simulates flipping a coin 5000 times in a row.

- Keep track of each time you get 'heads' and plot your working guess of the probability of getting 'heads' with that coin.

- Plot this working guess along with a horizontal line at the expected value of 0.5.

- This is most easily done without a loop (useful functions: rand, round, cumsum).
